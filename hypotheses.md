Poincar√© Conjecture: The hypothesis is that a three-dimensional manifold that is simply connected (i.e., any loop can be continuously contracted to a point) is topologically equivalent to a three-dimensional sphere.

Hodge Conjecture: This conjecture proposes that certain classes of cohomology (specifically, those of type 
(

,
ùëù
)
(p,p)) on non-singular projective algebraic varieties correspond to algebraic cycles. It attempts to bridge algebraic and transcendental methods in geometry.

Yang-Mills Theory: This problem seeks a rigorous mathematical foundation for Yang-Mills quantum field theory, particularly proving the existence of a "mass gap" (a positive gap between the lowest energy level and zero).

Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness: The hypothesis is that smooth and globally defined solutions exist for the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the behavior of viscous incompressible fluids, under reasonable initial conditions.
