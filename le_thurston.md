    <summary>
        The Thurston Programme hypothesizes that every 3-manifold can be built up from eight types of geometric structures,
        each with constant curvature. These eight types range from spherical to hyperbolic geometries. It draws comparison
        to 2-manifold classification (spherical, flat, hyperbolic) and seeks to include all 3-manifolds in this framework.
    </summary>
    
    <context>
        In geometry, a 3-manifold is a space where every point has a neighborhood that looks like 3D Euclidean space. 
        The goal is to classify these manifolds based on constant curvature geometries, similar to how 2D surfaces 
        (or 2-manifolds) are classified.
    </context>
    
    <hypothesis>
        Every 3-manifold can be built from one or a combination of eight possible geometries, including spherical, flat,
        and hyperbolic types. These geometries have distinct curvature characteristics that define the overall structure
        of the manifold.
    </hypothesis>
    
    <types_of_geometries>
        1. Spherical (positive curvature)
        2. Euclidean (zero curvature)
        3. Hyperbolic (negative curvature)
        4. Other five types involve complex structures with mixed curvature or different dimensional relationships.
    </types_of_geometries>

    <math_to_prove>
        To mathematically prove the hypothesis, it involves demonstrating that any 3-manifold can be decomposed into pieces
        that exhibit one of these constant curvature types, utilizing topological invariants and geometric decomposition 
        theorems (e.g., hyperbolic structures via Haken's theorem).
    </math_to_prove>

    <testing_approach>
        1. Define 3-manifolds and calculate their curvature across different regions.
        2. Decompose into simpler structures (using tools like triangulation).
        3. Compare each structure to one of the eight geometries and test if they fit within the constant curvature model.
